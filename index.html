            <h1>Why graduate early?</h1><br>
            <p><b>University is expensive.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The average cost of a public, four year in-state university bachelors degree is <b>$108,584.</b></li>
                <li>At 40 classes for a 120 credit degree, that's <b>$2714 per class</b> on average.</li>
                <li>At a public university housing is typically the primary expense with tuition a close second.</li>
                <li>At a private or out-of-state university tuition can be triple or more than an in-state public university.</li>
                <li>Considering the average person does not graduate in four years, college can put you in debt for life even at a public in-state university!</li>
                <li>See the costs for yourself. <a href="https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college">https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college</a>.</li>

            <!-- <p><b>You save years of your life!</b></p>
            <p>This is subjective, but there are many things that you may prefer doing to sitting in classes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start work sooner. University is expensive on it's own but if you add the opportunity cost of paying tuition instead of making an income working it becomes criminal.</li>
                <li>Travel the world! If you take the traditional four year path you will have so much debt that you will be forced to work and pay it off. Early graduation gives you <b>freedom</b>, the most valuable thing in the world. Go travel the world, hike the appalachian trail, start a family, make a huge pile of money, start a business, or whatever you want without debt hanging over you. Early graduation gives you options.</li>
                <li>As you get older, your time slips away faster, and faster, and faster until years go by in months, months go by in weeks, and weeks fade into a blur. Think hard on if you want to spend your youth sitting at a classroom desk for four or more years.</li>
            </ul><br> -->
            <p><b>Early graduation isn't hard!</b></p>
            <p>There are thousands of ways to get an advantage and finish faster. I know because I finished university four years early. (starting with 40+ credits and spending only one and a half years in university itself.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The earlier you start, the sooner you can graduate. In elementary, middle, or high school you can graduate early or skip entire grades by just asking a counselor. This won't save you money from university classes, however, and my negatively impact social development.</li>
                <li>If you are still in high school, you have the most options. It is very reasonable to enter college as a sophomore with 30+ credits from the abundance of opportunity to acquire them.</li>
                <li>If you are already in college you can still save plenty of time and money by getting credits outside from your university and compressing your courseload.</li>
                <li>By stacking every method you can <b>halve</b> your time and money spent in college.</li>
                <li>With <b>minimal effort</b> you can graduate in three years instead of four or five and save tens of thousands in tuition.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p><b>I will personally tell you how to do it.</b></p>
            <p>I graduated from college at 18 years old, had 40+ credits before I even started, and had a 3.96 GPA when I finished.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I host <a href="webinar.html">webinars</a> regularly.</li>
                <li><b>Nowhere else</b> on the internet is there as dense a concentration of knowledge on early graduation as there is here.</li>
                <li><b>Nowhere else</b> on the internet exist the original methods I used to get high grades with a high number of classes and low effort.</li>
                <li><b>Nowhere else</b> on the internet exists someone who knows every step of the way from personal experience and will explain it directly.</li>
